2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the app.

## What can this do?

It has the basic functionalities of a calculator. The only different thing I added is that it can fix almost every error a user can make:

-   it doesn't let you write numbers longer than 10 digits.
-   sets decimal numbers to just two decimals
-   prevents the user from pressing a math operator multiple times
-   displays the actual operation
-   has 3 awesome themes
